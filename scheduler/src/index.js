/**
 * Richfolio scheduler — a Cloudflare Worker that fires the GitHub Actions
 * workflows on time.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 *
 * GitHub's `schedule` event is not a scheduler you can rely on. Its own docs
 * say scheduled runs "may be delayed during periods of high load" and, at
 * sufficient load, dropped entirely — so this is documented behaviour, never
 * reported as an incident on githubstatus.com. GitHub staff acknowledged the
 * regression in community discussion #196910 (opened 2026-05-25, still open):
 * drift "has got worse", caused by load balancing under >30% growth in
 * scheduled job volume, with no committed fix date.
 *
 * Measured on this repo, the 22:00 UTC daily brief fired:
 *   2026-08-11..13   +51m      (~9:15am AEST — as designed)
 *   2026-08-14..25   +30m      (~8:55am AEST)
 *   2026-08-26       never     (dropped during an Actions incident)
 *   2026-08-27       +5h02m    (1:24pm AEST)
 *   2026-08-28       +8h03m    (4:30pm AEST)
 *   2026-08-29       +5h36m    (2:01pm AEST)
 *
 * Cloudflare Cron Triggers fire these workflows via `repository_dispatch`
 * instead. The GitHub `schedule:` triggers have been REMOVED from both
 * workflows rather than kept as a fallback: once GitHub finally delivers a
 * late cron it would run a second, duplicate brief — and `daily`/`intraday`
 * modes post publicly to X / Facebook / LinkedIn / Threads, so a duplicate is
 * not just a second email but a second public post. `workflow_dispatch` stays
 * on both workflows as the manual recovery path.
 *
 * COST: entirely within the Workers Free plan. Free allows 100,000 requests/day
 * and 5 Cron Triggers per ACCOUNT (not per Worker); this uses 4 triggers and
 * ~13 invocations/day. The 10ms free-plan CPU ceiling is not a constraint
 * either — Cloudflare does not count time awaiting `fetch()` toward CPU time,
 * and all this Worker does is build a small JSON body and POST it.
 */

/**
 * Cron expression → `repository_dispatch` event type.
 *
 * Keyed by the wrangler.jsonc cron strings, matched case- and
 * whitespace-insensitively (see `normalizeCron`) rather than by raw equality —
 * a lookup miss here sends nothing at all, which is too quiet a failure to hang
 * on the exact casing Cloudflare happens to echo back in `event.cron`.
 *
 * Day-of-week is written as 3-letter names on purpose: Cloudflare follows
 * Quartz, where 1 = SUNDAY, not Monday as in Unix cron. `1-5` would silently
 * mean Sun-Thu.
 *
 * The event type doubles as the run mode: each workflow filters on it via
 * `repository_dispatch.types`, and its "Determine mode" step reads
 * `github.event.action`. So `daily` reaches portfolio-monitor.yml and `crypto`
 * reaches crypto-monitor.yml with no routing logic here.
