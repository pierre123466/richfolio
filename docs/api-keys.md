# API Keys

Richfolio uses up to 5 external services, all with generous free tiers. Only Resend and a recipient email are required — everything else is optional.

Add each key as a repository Secret: Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → **Secrets** tab. Add `RECIPIENT_EMAIL` as a **Variable** instead (easier to view/edit).

## Resend (Email) — Required
{: .text-green-200}

Resend delivers the HTML email reports.

1. Go to [resend.com](https://resend.com) and sign up
2. Navigate to **API Keys** in the dashboard
3. Click **Create API Key**, give it a name, and copy the key
4. Add as a GitHub Secret — name: `RESEND_API_KEY`, value: the key you just copied

**Free tier:** 3,000 emails/month. Sends from `onboarding@resend.dev` by default. Can only send to your **account owner email** unless you verify a custom domain (Dashboard → Domains → Add Domain → add DNS records).

---

## Recipient Email — Required
{: .text-green-200}

Add as a GitHub **Variable** (not Secret): name: `RECIPIENT_EMAIL`, value: your email address.

Must match your Resend account email unless you've verified a custom domain.

---

## NewsAPI (Headlines) — Optional
{: .text-yellow-200}

Provides top headlines per ticker for the daily brief.

1. Go to [newsapi.org](https://newsapi.org) and sign up
2. Your API key is shown on the dashboard immediately
3. Add as a GitHub Secret — name: `NEWS_API_KEY`, value: the key from the dashboard

**Free tier:** 100 requests/day. Richfolio uses ~4 requests per run via batching. Headlines from the last 24 hours only. If not set, the brief runs without news.

---

## AI Providers — at least one required for AI recommendations

Richfolio supports three AI providers: **Google Gemini**, **Anthropic Claude** and **Mistral**. Set at least one for AI-powered recommendations. Set **two or more** to run them in parallel — scores are then averaged and a per-AI breakdown is shown next to every recommendation. If none is set, Richfolio falls back to gap-based recommendations (no AI).

| Mode | Setup | Output |
|---|---|---|
| **No AI** | No key set | Gap-based recommendations only |
| **Single AI** | One key set | Identical to today — one set of action + confidence per ticker |
| **Multi-AI** | Two or more keys set | Per-ticker consensus action + averaged confidence; per-AI breakdown shown beneath each rec; STRONG BUY capped by dissent distance |

---

## Google Gemini — Optional
{: .text-yellow-200}

Powers the AI buy recommendations with Gemini 2.5 Flash.

1. Go to [aistudio.google.com/apikey](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey)
2. Click **Create API Key**, select a Google Cloud project (or create one)
3. Copy the key and add as a GitHub Secret — name: `GEMINI_API_KEY`, value: the key you just copied

**Free tier:** As of August 2026, a live 429 for `gemini-2.5-flash` reported a quota of **~20 requests/day** (previously documented here as 250/day — Google changes these limits without notice, so treat [aistudio.google.com/rate-limit](https://aistudio.google.com/rate-limit) as the canonical source). Richfolio uses 2 requests per run (Stage 1 Observe + Stage 2 Decide), plus 1 per STRONG BUY ticker for detailed analysis, plus 1 for the daily news relevance filter. Across the full 6-run daily schedule (1 daily + 5 intraday) that's 13+ requests on a quiet day, so Gemini will often exhaust its quota and drop out of later runs — the brief still sends, with a `⚠ n/n AI` badge marking the degraded provider. New keys may take a few minutes for quota to activate (you might see 429 errors initially).

**Newly created keys cannot use `gemini-2.5-flash`.** Google retires models for new API keys before old ones — a key created in August 2026 returns `404 ... no longer available to new users` while an established key on the same model keeps working. Set the `GEMINI_MODEL` env var (default `gemini-2.5-flash`, left unchanged so existing keys are unaffected) to a current model such as `gemini-flash-latest`, an alias that tracks the newest Flash. The crypto workflow already does this.

**A second key for the crypto schedule:** if you use `watchingCrypto`, create a *separate* Gemini key and add it as `GEMINI_API_KEY_CRYPTO`. The crypto workflow runs 8×/day at 2 requests per run — 16/day on its own — so sharing one key with the equity schedule would exhaust both before mid-afternoon. The workflow maps it onto `GEMINI_API_KEY` at the step level, so no code knows the difference. It also pins `AI_DETAILED_PROVIDER=mistral` so the per-STRONG-BUY detailed call doesn't eat the remaining headroom. If Gemini still exhausts routinely, widen the cron in `crypto-monitor.yml` from `0 */3 * * *` to `0 */4 * * *` (6 runs = 12 requests).

### A note on Gemini model tiers

Google's pricing page states that Gemini 2.5 Pro is ["Free of charge"](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/pricing#gemini-2.5-pro) for both input and output tokens. In practice, however, free-tier Pro requests frequently hit `429 RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED` errors — even with minimal usage. Google does not publish the actual RPD (requests per day) limits for the free tier; third-party sources suggest Pro may be capped at ~100 RPD, but the real number appears to vary by account and is not guaranteed.

**Richfolio uses Gemini 2.5 Flash by default** because Flash has a more generous and reliable free-tier quota. The quality difference for financial analysis text is negligible.

## Anthropic Claude — Optional
{: .text-yellow-200}

Powers the AI buy recommendations with Claude (Sonnet 4.6 by default). There are two
ways to authenticate, and Richfolio picks whichever you configure.

### Option 1 — Claude Pro/Max subscription (no per-token cost)

If you already pay for Claude Pro or Max, Richfolio can run on your existing
subscription allocation instead of buying API credits.

1. Install Claude Code and sign in with the account holding your subscription
2. Run `claude setup-token` locally and copy the token it prints
3. Add as a GitHub Secret — name: `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN`, value: the token

**Leave `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` unset when you use this.** Inside Claude Code an API key
outranks the subscription token, so setting both would quietly bill your API account —
exactly what this option exists to avoid. Richfolio prefers the subscription token and
strips the API key from the subprocess, but the cleanest setup is to have only one.

**Validity:** roughly one year, with no auto-refresh. Unlike the Threads token there is
no refresh workflow — re-run `claude setup-token` annually. When it expires Claude drops
out of the run. In a multi-provider setup (Claude plus Gemini and/or Mistral), the
surviving provider(s) continue and the brief is marked `⚠ n/n AI` rather than failing —
but that badge only fires when 2+ providers are configured. If Claude is your only
provider, there's no survivor to promote a badge for: the brief silently falls back to
gap-based recommendations instead.

### Option 2 — API key (pay-per-use)

1. Go to [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com) and sign up
2. Navigate to **API Keys** → **Create Key**, give it a name, copy the key
3. Add as a GitHub Secret — name: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, value: the key you just copied

**Pricing:** Anthropic does not have a permanent free tier like Gemini, but new accounts receive a small starter credit and Sonnet usage for Richfolio's workload is typically cents per day. To minimise cost, set `CLAUDE_MODEL=claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` (the Haiku tier is significantly cheaper while still handling this workload well).

---

## Mistral — Optional
{: .text-yellow-200}

Powers the AI buy recommendations. The code default is `mistral-large-latest`, but **the free tier cannot run it** — set `MISTRAL_MODEL` (see below).

1. Go to [console.mistral.ai](https://console.mistral.ai) and sign up
2. Navigate to **API Keys** → **Create new key**, copy the key
3. Add as a GitHub Secret — name: `MISTRAL_API_KEY`, value: the key you just copied

**Free tier — you must set `MISTRAL_MODEL`:** the free tier grants only the `ministral-*` family. `mistral-large-latest` (the code default) returns `403 tier_not_allowed`, and every `mistral-small/medium-*` and `magistral-*` model reports `x-ratelimit-limit-req-minute: 0` — no allowance at all, not a throttle you can retry past. Leave it unset on a free key and Mistral contributes nothing: the run logs `Provider Mistral failed` and quietly degrades to the other providers. Set `MISTRAL_MODEL=ministral-14b-latest` (30 req/min, 256k context, the largest the free tier allows); `ministral-8b-latest` (188/min) and `ministral-3b-latest` (750/min) trade quality for headroom. Check what a key actually allows with `curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $MISTRAL_API_KEY" https://api.mistral.ai/v1/models` — and read the limit header, since a model can be listed yet have a 0/min allowance.

Mistral is a good second provider precisely because it is an independent model lineage from Gemini — a second model only adds information when its disagreement reflects the data rather than the model being weaker.

---

## Multi-AI mode

If two or more of `GEMINI_API_KEY`, Claude (`CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` or `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`) and `MISTRAL_API_KEY` are set, Richfolio runs those providers concurrently on every analysis and aggregates the results:

- **Consensus action** per ticker via majority vote (with confidence-sum tiebreaker)
- **Averaged confidence** displayed prominently; per-AI scores shown beneath
- **STRONG BUY capped by dissent distance** — a STRONG BUY survives while every dissenter is within one rung of it (a dissenting `BUY` agrees about direction), and caps at BUY as soon as one is further out (`HOLD`/`WAIT`). `SB + SB + BUY` stands; `SB + SB + HOLD` caps
- **Agreement label** (unanimous / majority / split) shown as a badge next to the action

The aggregated action is a summary, not a gate. Every provider's action, confidence and reasoning renders beneath it, and any ticker a provider called STRONG BUY keeps its detailed-analysis page, its "More Details" link, its limit price and its technicals — capped or not. You see the votes and decide.

To require unanimity instead — any dissent at all demotes STRONG BUY to BUY — set `"ai": { "strongBuyRequiresAllProviders": true }` in `config.json`.

If a provider fails mid-run (rate-limited, quota exhausted, network error), the surviving providers continue without it. The run is then marked **degraded**: every recommendation carries a `⚠ 1/2 AI`-style badge in the email (a tag in Telegram), because a lone provider's vote should not read as a cross-checked one. The action itself is left alone by default — a provider that never answered is not a dissenter at any distance — unless `strongBuyRequiresAllProviders` is on, which caps a degraded STRONG BUY too. This does not apply when only one provider is configured; that setup never promised a comparison.

### Choosing which provider generates the detailed STRONG BUY analysis page

When several providers are active, the per-STRONG-BUY analysis page (the "More Details" link) is generated by a single provider — by default the first available one in registry order (Gemini, then Claude, then Mistral). Override with:

| Env var | Value | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `AI_DETAILED_PROVIDER` | `gemini` | Force Gemini for detailed analysis (must have GEMINI_API_KEY set) |
| `AI_DETAILED_PROVIDER` | `claude` | Force Claude for detailed analysis (must have `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` or `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` set) |
| `AI_DETAILED_PROVIDER` | `mistral` | Force Mistral for detailed analysis (must have MISTRAL_API_KEY set) |
| `MISTRAL_MODEL` | `ministral-14b-latest` | **Required on the free tier** — the default `mistral-large-latest` is paid-tier only |
| `CLAUDE_MODEL` | e.g. `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` | Override Claude model (default: `claude-sonnet-4-6`) |

An `AI_DETAILED_PROVIDER` naming a provider whose key is not set (or an unknown name) is logged and ignored, falling back to registry order — pinning a provider with no API key would otherwise fail every ticker.

## Telegram Bot — Optional
{: .text-yellow-200}

Delivers condensed summaries to your Telegram account.

### Create the bot

1. Open Telegram and search for **@BotFather**
2. Send `/newbot`
3. Choose a name (e.g., "Richfolio Brief") and username (must end in `bot`, e.g., `richfolio_brief_bot`)
4. BotFather replies with your bot token — copy it

### Get your chat ID

1. Search for **@userinfobot** on Telegram and start it
2. It replies with your numeric user ID — this is your chat ID

**Important:** Send any message to your new bot (e.g., "hi") before running Richfolio — this is required before the bot can message you.

Add both as GitHub Secrets:

- Name: `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`, value: the token from BotFather
- Name: `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID`, value: your numeric user ID

**Notes:** If not set, the brief skips Telegram. Messages are condensed summaries (not full HTML). 4,096 character limit per message — news is truncated if needed.

---

## Social Posting — Optional
{: .text-yellow-200}

Richfolio can publish generic buy signals to public accounts on X, Facebook, Threads, and LinkedIn. Every platform is optional and stays off until configured. Required secrets per platform:

- **Facebook:** `FACEBOOK_PAGE_ID`, `FACEBOOK_PAGE_TOKEN`
- **Threads:** `THREADS_USER_ID`, `THREADS_ACCESS_TOKEN` (+ optional `THREADS_TOKEN_PAT` to auto-refresh the ~60-day token)
- **LinkedIn:** `LINKEDIN_ACCESS_TOKEN`, `LINKEDIN_ORG_URN`
- **X/Twitter:** `X_API_KEY`, `X_API_SECRET`, `X_ACCESS_TOKEN`, `X_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET`

**Notes:** Posts are generic — no holdings or allocations are disclosed. If unset, social posting is skipped. See [Social Posting](social-setup) for step-by-step setup of each platform.
